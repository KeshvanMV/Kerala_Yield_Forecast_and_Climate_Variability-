# Kerala_Yield_Forecast_and_Climate_Variability-
A data-driven analysis of Kerala’s agricultural resilience under changing climate conditions (1961–2025). This project integrates IMD, NASA POWER, and UPAg datasets to examine rainfall variability, soil moisture persistence, and lagged climate effects on major crop yields.
